## Installation
Since this application doesn't currently contain front-end information, the code will have tio be downloaded and run through a program like Insomnia.

## Usage
Once you have the code downloaded to your device, all you have to do is open a command line linked to it and enter the following command.
```bash
node index.js
```
Once you've done this, you have access to five routes available to utilise with both users and thoughts. These are: 
* Viewing all users/thoughts present in the database
* View a singular user/thought from the database through its ID
* Creating a new user/thought
* Updating an existing user/thought through its ID
* Deleting an existing user/thought through its ID
Any route requiring an ID is set to search for in within provided parameters (e.g. /api/users/ID).
